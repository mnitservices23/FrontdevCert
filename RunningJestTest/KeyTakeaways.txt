To check if Dependencies are installed run the below:
> node --version
> npm --version
> jest --version

When started with a new project run the code in terminal to setup Dependencies
 > nmp init //this will walk your through the package.json file
 Or run the below for a faster outcome
 > npm init -y  /// this will answer yes to all the steps

next on your new project run the below command to save Jest as a dependency and save it to the DEVDependencies
>nmp install --save-dev jest

Once jest is intalled go to the package.json file and update the script section to use jest:
 "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },

now you are good to go - write your test file. Use name convention below:
    functionName.test.json

once test is finished you can run the command below in the terminal to run tests
    >npm run test
